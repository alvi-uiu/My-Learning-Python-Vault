### Why Python : 

1. Design Philosophy: Python is designed to be readable and clean. It follows the idea that code should be simple and straightforward to understand. As they say, "Simple is better than complex."

2. Batteries Included : Python comes with lots of built-in features and functions right out of the box. No need to install extra tools for basic programming tasks.

3. General Purpose: Python is versatile. Can be used in almost anything: web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, games, and more. It's like a Swiss Army knife of programming languages :)

4. Libraries/Community: Python has a huge collection of additional packages (libraries) , and a large, helpful community of developers.
