### Why Python : 

1. Design Philosophy: Python is designed to be readable and clean. It follows the idea that code should be simple and straightforward to understand. As they say, "Simple is better than complex."

2. Batteries Included : Python comes with lots of built-in features and functions right out of the box. No need to install extra tools for basic programming tasks.

3. General Purpose: Python is versatile. Can be used in almost anything: web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, games, and more. It's like a Swiss Army knife of programming languages :)

4. Libraries/Community: Python has a huge collection of additional packages (libraries) , and a large, helpful community of developers. 





### Why Python For Data-Science : 

1. Easy to Learn: Python has a simple, clean syntax that's similar to English. Even if one is new to python , he can easily grab it.

2. Proximity with Maths: Python makes it easy to work with mathematical operations and functions. Its libraries like NumPy and SciPy make complex mathematical calculations straightforward. The code often looks similar to actual mathematical equations, making it natural for data scientists.

3. Community: There's a huge community of data scientists using Python. This means:
   - Lots of free learning resources
   - Many helpful people to ask questions
   - Plenty of ready-to-use tools and libraries for data science
   - Regular updates and improvements to data science tools
